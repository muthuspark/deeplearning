    "The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus is a large dataset for natural language understanding tasks that deals with \"recognizing textual entailment\" (RTE), which is the problem of determining the inference relationship between two sentences . The dataset consists of 570k pairs of human-crafted English sentence-pairs that are manually labeled as entailment, contradiction, or neutral. It is designed to evaluate natural language inference (NLI) systems , which aim to determine if a hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary application of the SNLI Corpus is for the training and evaluation of machine learning models on natural language understanding tasks. The dataset has become a standard benchmark for evaluating models in the NLI domain, and many recent state-of-the-art models for NLI have been trained on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the SNLI Corpus has been a significant contribution to the field of natural language understanding, providing researchers with a standard dataset for evaluating and benchmarking NLI systems.\n",

    "### Build a model\n",
    "We will build our model using the TensorFlow distribution strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` is a TensorFlow distribution strategy that is used when training a model on multiple GPUs or a single multi-GPU machine. With this strategy, the model will be replicated across all the available GPUs, and each replica will process a different portion of the input data in parallel. Gradient updates are then combined across the replicas to update the model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `MirroredStrategy`, the with `strategy.scope()`: context manager is typically used to define the model and optimizer inside the strategy scope, so that they are automatically distributed across all the replicas. This ensures that the model and optimizer are available on every device in the strategy, and that the variables are automatically mirrored across the devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example usage of `MirroredStrategy` with the scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",

    "#### BERT tokenizer\n",
    "A BERT tokenizer, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers tokenizer, is a natural language processing tool used for tokenization, which is the process of breaking up raw text into smaller chunks that can be used for further analysis, such as machine learning or deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to traditional tokenizers that split text into individual words or characters, BERT uses a WordPiece tokenizer, which breaks words down into smaller subword units, such as prefixes or suffixes, to better capture the complex relationships between different words in natural language text. This allows BERT to better handle rare or unknown words, and to generalize better to new text inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attention Masks\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP) and specifically in the context of transformers like BERT, an attention mask is an optional input used to specify which tokens of a sequence should be attended to by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, sequences of words or embeddings are often used as input to models. However, sequences can have varying lengths, so models typically require inputs of fixed length. When batching sequences together for training, sequences in a batch with shorter lengths are padded with zeros to match the length of the longest sequence. The attention mask is used to tell the transformer model which tokens in the input sequence are real tokens and which are just padding tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mask is usually a tensor of 0's and 1's with the same shape as the input sequence. It has a value of 1 for real tokens and 0 for padding tokens. During self-attention mechanism, in which a sequence attends to itself to compute a representation, tokens with value 0 in the mask are ignored so the model does not attend to the padded positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention masks can also be used to handle input sequences with different lengths by dynamically masking the appropriate tokens, rather than padding all sequences to the same length."
